"""
From User Story 3474:
For testing of stage 2 Delphi surveys, we used to copy user_ids from test group and paste
those into a copy of the Qualtrics Contact List dataset for production. Now that we
are using anon_project_specific_user_ids instead, each test user will have to have a
UserProject for that project in order to have an anon_project_specific_user_id
that we can use.

The goal of this US is to write a admin script to generate UserProjects for
each user in a given UserGroup. It should:
- prompt for a project_task_id corresponding to the task that will be tested
- create one UserProject for each user in that task's test group if the user does not already
have a UserProject
- output a list (csv probably best) of anon_project_specific_user_ids that can be
pasted into the Qualtrics' Contact List spreadsheet.
