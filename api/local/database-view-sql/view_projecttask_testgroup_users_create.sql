/*
 Purpose: To list the project tasks with status=testing that each user can see on the web UI.
 When a project task has status=testing then only those users who are in the user group designated as the test user group can see the project task
 Usage:  Normally queried by user_id.  This gives one row for each project task the user can see, i.e. row exits = visible, no row = not visible.
 The columns returned may not be required by caller, but enable this view's contents to be easily understood and checked
