/*
 Purpose: To list the private projects that each user can see on the web UI.  Projects are either public (visible to all) or private in which case
 visibility is controlled by membership of user groups with permission to see that project.
 Usage:  Normally queried by user_id.  This gives one row for each project the user can see, i.e. row exits = visible, no row = not visible.
 The columns returned may not be required by caller, but enable this view's contents to be easily understood and checked
